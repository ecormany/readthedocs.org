Configuration file
==================

You can use a configuration file in the root of your project.
The configuration file should be named ``.readthedocs.yaml``.

.. note::

   Some other variants like ``readthedocs.yaml``, ``.readthedocs.yml``, etc
   are deprecated.

The main advantages of using a configuration file are:

- Settings are per version rather than per project.
- Settings live in your VCS.
- They enable reproducible build environments over time.
